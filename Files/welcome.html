<p>Thank you for installing this app. I hope you will have a lot of fun with it.</p>
<h3>Quick Mute</h3>
<p>To mute your microphone, click the microphone icon. If you click on the speaker, a menu appears to let you select where to mute yourself.<br />
If a question mark appears next to the microphone icon, muting or unmuting your microphone will have no effect, as your microphone isn't activated on any server or your speakers are muted on the server where your microphone is activated.</p>
<h3>Server Tree</h3>
<p>You can select people by clicking on their names. Click a channel to select all its members, or use the menu bar to select people by their status.</p>
<p>After selecting people, you can chat with them via the menu bar or move them all at once by clicking on the target channel’s name.</p>
<p>You can also use the channel tree to move to another channel.</p>
<h3>Chat Messages</h3>
<p>If you receive a chat message, you can hover it to close or reply either in the channel it came from or by whispering the sender. If you receive a YouTube link, you can embed the video for a preview or listening. The link will still be there to maximize.</p>
